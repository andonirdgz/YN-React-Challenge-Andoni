# YouNoodle React Challenge Solution - Andoni Rodriguez


## Pre-requisites
- Node >= 18.0.0

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the server
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

## Notes
- Every Task comment still in the code to allow you to evaluate more easily the solution.
- Every task was implemented in a separate branch and then merged to the main branch to better keep track of the process of solving each task in an organized way.
- Each non-explanation bullet point of the tasks are marked with a checkmark (âœ…) just for me to keep track of the progress of the tasks.
